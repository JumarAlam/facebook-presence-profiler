# Facebook Presence Profiler
Profile your Facebook friends' online presence! Find the timespans spent online, average time online or any other crazy statistics you might want to pull out. (This is a very crude implementation for a basic experiment I carried out. Feel free to improve and send a pull).

## How to use:

 * Perform your profiling as long as you want; after finished, paste the relevant output from the browser to a text file.
 * `python result_processor.py <filepath>`
